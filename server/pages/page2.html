<p>Increase adoption and productivity by simplifying the open source UI. Match your desired look and feel. Hide unnecessary features -- or add custom annotations that trigger workflows.</p>
<p>Our primary requirement was, here is a big chunk of demanding PDF files. Can you open them? When we pushed most of these 190 PDFs through PDFTron, we couldn’t find one that didn’t open. And from what I could tell, PDFTron handled the memory issue the best... I absolutely feel we’re in a better position to handle all our present and future PDF requirements.</p>
<p>If somebody were to ask me about a vendor -- on a technical, personal and commercial level -- my advice would be to go with PDFTron. They really removed from our table any concerns about our ability to scale. They really know what they’re doing and they have the experience to support us. It feels good to have someone we know we can stick with.</p>
